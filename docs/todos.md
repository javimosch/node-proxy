# Node Proxy UI Project: Remaining Tasks

## Backend

- [x] Set up MongoDB connection
- [x] Create ProxyConfig schema and model
- [x] Implement RPC API endpoint
- [x] Create database population script

## Frontend

- [x] Implement React components:
  - [x] ConfigTable.js: Component to display all proxy configurations in a table format with edit/delete buttons
  - [x] AddConfigForm.js: Form component for adding new proxy configurations
  - [x] EditConfigForm.js: Form component for editing existing proxy configurations

- [x] Update App.js:
  - [x] Implement state management for configurations
  - [x] Add fetch logic to retrieve configurations from backend
  - [x] Implement handlers for add, edit, delete, and reload actions
  - [x] Add error handling and success notifications

- [x] Add basic styling to components

## Integration

- [ ] Test communication between frontend and backend
- [ ] Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Test proxy functionality with configurations from MongoDB

## Deployment

- [ ] Build the frontend application
- [ ] Configure the Express server to serve static files from the build directory
- [ ] Test the production build

## Documentation

- [ ] Document the API endpoints
- [ ] Add usage instructions
- [ ] Document project structure

## Next Steps

1. Implement the React components as per the project requirements
2. Create RPC communication functions to interact with the backend
3. Test all operations to ensure they work correctly
4. Add styling to improve the user interface
5. Deploy the application for production use
